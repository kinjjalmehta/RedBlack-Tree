# RedBlack-Tree
Created on October 8, 2020

An implementation of a red black tree data structure.

Red Black trees are binary search trees with the following properties:

1. Every node has either red or black color associated with them.
2. The root node is black.
3. The children of a red node are black.
4. For each node with at least one null child, the number of black nodes on the path from the root to the null child is the same.

Insertion, Deletion, and Search have a worst-case time complexity of O(log N).
